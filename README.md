# Anatomy
 Diagram of the Human Anatomy

This is a simple application where the user can click on a body part and see the skeletal anatomy of that specific part. This project improved my skills in working with the DOM, and styling within the JavaScript environment.

This being one of the first things i've built, I feel there is huge room for improvement especially in DRY code. If I were to improve this application, I would make it responsive and gear it towards a technical documentation page where there is an array of resources the user can learn from when it comes to anatomy and medicine. That being said it was a huge learning lesson and it got my feet wet.
